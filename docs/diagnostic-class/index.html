            <h2>Classification Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Diagnostic Classification System provides a structured taxonomy for categorizing boundary
                behaviors within institutional contexts. This classification enables systematic identification,
                analysis, and comparison of boundary-respecting and boundary-violating patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system operates as both a descriptive tool for documenting observed behaviors and an analytical
                framework for evaluating institutional boundary integrity.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Primary Classifications</h2>

            <h3>Class A: Boundary-Respecting Behaviors</h3>
            <p>
                Systems demonstrating consistent boundary maintenance and appropriate scope limitation.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>A1: Clear Boundary Definition</h4>
                <p>
                    Explicit documentation of scope limits, authority boundaries, and judgment criteria.
                    Boundaries are publicly accessible and consistently referenced in decision-making processes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>A2: Consistent Boundary Maintenance</h4>
                <p>
                    Regular adherence to established boundaries across cases and contexts. Decision-making
                    remains within defined scope without criterion manipulation or scope expansion.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>A3: Boundary Recognition and Deference</h4>
                <p>
                    Explicit acknowledgment of boundary limits. System defers to appropriate alternative
                    authorities or stakeholders for matters outside legitimate scope.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>A4: Transparent Boundary Evolution</h4>
                <p>
                    When boundaries require modification, changes occur through explicit, transparent processes
                    with stakeholder input and formal authorization.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Class B: Boundary-Ambiguous Behaviors</h3>
            <p>
                Systems with unclear boundaries or inconsistent boundary application, creating uncertainty about
                legitimate scope.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>B1: Undefined Boundaries</h4>
                <p>
                    Absence of clear boundary specification. Scope and authority limits remain implicit or
                    subject to ad hoc interpretation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>B2: Inconsistent Application</h4>
                <p>
                    Boundaries exist formally but application varies across cases. Some decisions respect
                    boundaries while others extend beyond established scope.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>B3: Boundary Ambiguity Maintenance</h4>
                <p>
                    Deliberate preservation of unclear boundaries to enable flexible interpretation and
                    discretionary scope expansion.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Class C: Boundary-Violating Behaviors</h3>
            <p>
                Systems demonstrating systematic boundary violations through scope expansion, criterion
                manipulation, or authority overreach.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>C1: Scope Overreach</h4>
                <p>
                    Exercise of judgment beyond legitimate authority or competence boundaries. System makes
                    determinations on matters outside its proper domain.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>C2: Criterion Shifting</h4>
                <p>
                    Modification of evaluation criteria to enable desired outcomes. Standards change to
                    accommodate predetermined judgments rather than consistently applied criteria.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>C3: Proxy Judgment Substitution</h4>
                <p>
                    System substitutes its judgment for legitimate stakeholder judgment. Preferences or
                    determinations properly belonging to affected parties are overridden.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>C4: Boundary Erosion</h4>
                <p>
                    Gradual expansion of scope through incremental boundary violations. Each individual
                    extension appears minor but cumulative effect significantly expands system authority.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>C5: Accountability Evasion</h4>
                <p>
                    System structures or practices that obscure boundary violations or prevent boundary
                    enforcement. Lack of transparency enables persistent overreach.

            <h2>Dimensional Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond primary classifications, the system assesses behaviors across several dimensions:
            </p>

            <h3>Severity Dimension</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minor:</strong> Limited boundary extension with minimal stakeholder impact</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Significant scope expansion affecting multiple stakeholders</li>
                <li><strong>Major:</strong> Systematic boundary violation fundamentally exceeding legitimate authority</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Intentionality Dimension</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inadvertent:</strong> Boundary violation resulting from unclear boundaries or insufficient guidance</li>
                <li><strong>Negligent:</strong> Violation due to failure to maintain appropriate boundary awareness</li>
                <li><strong>Deliberate:</strong> Intentional boundary extension or violation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frequency Dimension</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Isolated:</strong> Single incident not reflecting pattern</li>
                <li><strong>Occasional:</strong> Intermittent violations with periods of boundary respect</li>
                <li><strong>Systematic:</strong> Consistent pattern of boundary violation across cases</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reversibility Dimension</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Easily Correctable:</strong> Violation can be remedied through policy clarification or procedural adjustment</li>
                <li><strong>Partially Reversible:</strong> Some consequences of violation persist despite corrective action</li>
                <li><strong>Irreversible:</strong> Violation creates lasting institutional or stakeholder harm</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Diagnostic Procedure</h2>
            <p>
                Application of the classification system follows a structured diagnostic process:
            </p>

            <h3>Step 1: Behavior Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                Collect evidence of institutional boundary behaviors through policy analysis, decision review,
                and stakeholder accounts. Document both formal boundary structures and actual boundary practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 2: Primary Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Assign primary classification (A, B, or C) based on overall pattern of boundary behaviors.
                Consider consistency of boundary maintenance and presence of systematic violations.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Sub-Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Identify specific sub-categories applicable to observed behaviors. Multiple sub-classifications
                may apply to a single institutional context.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 4: Dimensional Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                Evaluate severity, intentionality, frequency, and reversibility dimensions. This assessment
                informs prioritization of remedial actions.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 5: Pattern Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Examine relationships between different boundary behaviors. Identify whether violations occur
                across multiple categories or concentrate in specific areas.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Practical Applications</h2>

            <h3>Institutional Audit</h3>
            <p>
                The classification system enables systematic institutional boundary audits. Organizations can
                assess their boundary behaviors and identify areas requiring attention or remediation.
            </p>

            <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Classification facilitates comparison across institutions or organizational units. Common
                patterns of boundary violation may indicate structural issues requiring systemic intervention.
            </p>

            <h3>Monitoring and Accountability</h3>
            <p>
                Regular classification assessment provides longitudinal data on institutional boundary behaviors.
                This monitoring enables early detection of boundary erosion and accountability for violations.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Guidance</h3>
            <p>
                The classification system informs design of new institutional structures by highlighting
                boundary behaviors to promote (Class A) and avoid (Class C).
            </p>
