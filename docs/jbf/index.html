            <h2>Framework Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Judgment Boundary Framework (JBF) provides a systematic methodology for identifying, analyzing,
                and evaluating boundary structures within institutional systems. The framework enables rigorous
                assessment of where judgment is appropriately exercised and where boundaries must be maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
                JBF operates as both a diagnostic tool for existing systems and a design framework for new
                institutional structures. The methodology applies across diverse organizational contexts while
                maintaining theoretical consistency and analytical rigor.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Core Concepts</h2>

            <h3>Judgment Boundaries</h3>
            <p>
                A judgment boundary defines the scope within which a system legitimately exercises evaluative
                authority. These boundaries delineate what falls within versus outside the system's proper domain
                of assessment and decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Judgment boundaries differ from operational boundaries or resource boundaries. They specifically
                concern the scope of legitimate evaluative authority rather than capacity or jurisdiction in a
                purely administrative sense.
            </p>

            <h3>Boundary Markers</h3>
            <p>
                The framework identifies several categories of boundary markers that signal appropriate limits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Competence boundaries:</strong> Limits based on system expertise or knowledge domain</li>
                <li><strong>Authority boundaries:</strong> Limits based on legitimate jurisdiction or mandate</li>
                <li><strong>Informational boundaries:</strong> Limits based on available or accessible information</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal boundaries:</strong> Limits based on appropriate time horizons for judgment</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder boundaries:</strong> Limits based on whose interests the system legitimately represents</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Boundary Violations</h3>
            <p>
                The framework distinguishes several types of boundary violations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overreach:</strong> Exercise of judgment beyond legitimate scope</li>
                <li><strong>Criterion shifting:</strong> Modification of evaluation criteria to enable desired outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Scope expansion:</strong> Gradual extension of judgment domain without explicit authorization</li>
                <li><strong>Proxy judgment:</strong> Substitution of system judgment for stakeholder judgment</li>
                <li><strong>Boundary ambiguity:</strong> Deliberate maintenance of unclear boundaries to enable flexible interpretation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Analytical Dimensions</h2>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Structural Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Examination of formal boundary definitions, documented procedures, stated criteria, and
                    organizational structure. This dimension assesses what boundaries are officially recognized
                    and how they are institutionally encoded.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Behavioral Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Observation of actual decision-making patterns, judgment exercises, and boundary maintenance
                    or violation behaviors. This dimension reveals the enacted boundaries regardless of formal
                    documentation.

                    Assessment of decision outcomes, affected stakeholders, and consequences of boundary
                    maintenance or violation. This dimension evaluates the effects of boundary behaviors on
                    institutional legitimacy and stakeholder interests.

                    Evaluation of whether observed boundaries align with appropriate scope for the institutional
                    context. This dimension applies normative criteria to assess boundary legitimacy and
                    appropriateness.

            <h2>Application Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                Application of the JBF follows a structured analytical sequence:
            </p>

            <h3>Phase 1: Boundary Identification</h3>
            <p>
                Map the formal and informal boundaries within the system. Document stated scope, criteria,
                procedures, and authority limits. Identify areas of boundary ambiguity or conflict.
            </p>

            <h3>Phase 2: Behavior Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                Observe and record actual judgment exercises and decision-making patterns. Note instances of
                boundary testing, boundary maintenance, and boundary violation. Collect evidence of criterion
                application or modification.
            </p>

            <h3>Phase 3: Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Compare stated boundaries with enacted boundaries. Identify discrepancies between formal policy
                and actual practice. Assess consistency of boundary maintenance across cases or contexts.
            </p>

            <h3>Phase 4: Normative Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                Apply normative criteria to assess boundary appropriateness. Evaluate whether boundaries align
                with legitimate authority, competence, and stakeholder interests. Identify areas requiring
                boundary adjustment or clarification.
            </p>

            <h3>Phase 5: Recommendation Development</h3>
            <p>
                Formulate specific recommendations for boundary clarification, modification, or enforcement.
                Prioritize recommendations based on severity of violations or magnitude of institutional impact.
            </p>

            <h2>Diagnostic Tools</h2>
            <p>
                The framework includes several diagnostic instruments for systematic evaluation:

        <section>
            <h2>Theoretical Foundations</h2>
            <p>
                The JBF draws upon established theoretical frameworks while introducing novel analytical constructs.
                Detailed theoretical development, including formal definitions and proofs, appears in the accompanying
                framework paper available through the <a href="../info/">citations section</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The framework's validity has been assessed through application to diverse institutional contexts,
                with findings documented in the empirical research papers.
