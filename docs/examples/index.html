            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This section presents detailed application of the <a href="/jbf/">Judgment Boundary Framework</a>
                across diverse institutional contexts. Each example demonstrates systematic boundary analysis,
                application of the <a href="/diagnostic-class/">classification system</a>, and development of
                evidence-based conclusions.

            <h2>Example 1: Academic Peer Review System</h2>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                A university department implements a peer review process for promotion and tenure decisions.
                The process involves evaluation of research, teaching, and service contributions according to
                documented criteria.
            </p>

            <h3>Boundary Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Stated Boundaries:</strong> The peer review committee evaluates candidates against
                established criteria in three domains. Committee authority extends to assessment of work quality
                and fit with departmental standards. Final decisions rest with administrative leadership following
                committee recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Observed Behaviors:</strong> Over a three-year period, the committee consistently evaluated
                research and teaching contributions according to documented criteria. However, in several cases,
                committee discussions extended to speculation about candidates' future research directions and
                potential productivity—matters outside the committee's competence to judge with reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                In one case, the committee declined to recommend a candidate who met all formal criteria, citing
                concerns about the candidate's "commitment to the institution" based on informal conversations
                rather than documented behavior. This represents substitution of subjective judgment for
                established criteria.
            </p>

            <h3>Classification</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Primary Classification:</strong> Class B (Boundary-Ambiguous)<br>
                <strong>Sub-classifications:</strong> B2 (Inconsistent Application), C1 (Scope Overreach) in isolated cases<br>
                <strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate<br>
                <strong>Frequency:</strong> Occasional
            </p>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Clarify that speculation about future performance falls outside committee competence</li>
                <li>Limit evaluation to documented evidence and established criteria</li>
                <li>Implement procedural checks requiring explicit citation of criteria for negative recommendations</li>
                <li>Provide committee training on boundary maintenance and criterion application</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Example 2: Healthcare Authorization System</h2>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                An insurance company implements a prior authorization system for specialized medical treatments.
                The stated purpose is verification that proposed treatments meet medical necessity criteria
                established in policy documents.
            </p>

            <h3>Boundary Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Stated Boundaries:</strong> Authorization reviewers assess whether proposed treatments
                align with documented medical necessity criteria. Treating physicians determine appropriate
                treatment based on clinical judgment; reviewers verify alignment with coverage policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Observed Behaviors:</strong> Analysis of authorization patterns revealed systematic
                denial of treatments that met documented medical necessity criteria. When patterns were
                questioned, the company introduced new "utilization management guidelines" not previously
                disclosed to physicians or patients.
            </p>
            <p>
                This represents criterion shifting—modification of standards to achieve predetermined outcomes
                rather than consistent application of stable criteria. The behavior also demonstrates scope
                overreach, as the system substituted its judgment for clinical judgment regarding treatment
                appropriateness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further investigation revealed financial incentives for authorization reviewers based on denial
                rates, creating structural pressure toward boundary violations.
            </p>

            <h3>Classification</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Primary Classification:</strong> Class C (Boundary-Violating)<br>
                <strong>Sub-classifications:</strong> C1 (Scope Overreach), C2 (Criterion Shifting), C3 (Proxy Judgment Substitution), C5 (Accountability Evasion)<br>
                <strong>Severity:</strong> Major<br>
                <strong>Frequency:</strong> Systematic<br>
                <strong>Intentionality:</strong> Deliberate
            </p>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Eliminate financial incentives tied to denial rates</li>
                <li>Require public disclosure of all medical necessity criteria prior to authorization review</li>
                <li>Prohibit introduction of undisclosed criteria in authorization decisions</li>
                <li>Implement external audit of authorization patterns for systematic criterion shifting</li>
                <li>Establish clear deference to treating physician clinical judgment where criteria are met</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Example 3: Content Moderation Platform</h2>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                A social media platform implements content moderation policies to address prohibited content
                categories including spam, illegal content, and targeted harassment.
            </p>

            <h3>Boundary Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Stated Boundaries:</strong> Platform policies define specific categories of prohibited
                content with accompanying definitions and examples. Moderation enforces these policies through
                a combination of automated systems and human review.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Observed Behaviors:</strong> Documentation analysis revealed consistent enforcement of
                policies regarding spam and illegal content. However, enforcement of harassment policies showed
                significant inconsistency, with similar behaviors receiving different outcomes depending on
                contextual factors not specified in policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Investigation also identified "strategic amplification" practices where platform algorithms
                promoted specific content types not based on user preferences but on platform business objectives.
                While not violating stated content policies, this represents extension of platform judgment
                beyond stated scope of neutral content distribution.
            </p>

            <h3>Classification</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Primary Classification:</strong> Class B (Boundary-Ambiguous) with Class C elements<br>
                <strong>Sub-classifications:</strong> B2 (Inconsistent Application), B3 (Boundary Ambiguity Maintenance), C1 (Scope Overreach) for amplification practices<br>
                <strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate to Major depending on sub-classification<br>
                <strong>Frequency:</strong> Systematic for ambiguity maintenance; Occasional for scope overreach
            </p>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop explicit, publicly-documented criteria for contextual factors in harassment policy enforcement</li>
                <li>Separate content moderation (policy enforcement) from content amplification (editorial judgment)</li>
                <li>Disclose amplification criteria and provide users control over amplification preferences</li>
                <li>Implement consistency audits for enforcement patterns across similar cases</li>
                <li>Establish external review mechanisms for appeals of boundary-violating enforcement decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Example 4: Professional Licensing Board</h2>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                A state professional licensing board regulates practitioners in a healthcare field. The board
                issues licenses, investigates complaints, and enforces professional standards through disciplinary
                actions when appropriate.
            </p>

            <h3>Boundary Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Stated Boundaries:</strong> Board authority derives from state statute defining scope of
                professional practice and grounds for disciplinary action. The board evaluates practitioners
                against professional standards within the licensed scope of practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Observed Behaviors:</strong> Review of board actions over five years revealed consistent
                enforcement of clear professional standards violations. The board demonstrated appropriate
                deference to clinical judgment within the scope of practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                In cases involving novel treatments or emerging practice areas, the board sought input from
                relevant experts and avoided prejudgment. When practitioners were accused of behavior outside
                the board's jurisdiction, the board appropriately referred matters to other authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The board regularly published decisions with clear explanation of reasoning and citation of
                applicable standards, maintaining transparency and consistency.
            </p>

            <h3>Classification</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Primary Classification:</strong> Class A (Boundary-Respecting)<br>
                <strong>Sub-classifications:</strong> A1 (Clear Boundary Definition), A2 (Consistent Boundary Maintenance), A3 (Boundary Recognition and Deference)<br>
                <strong>Exemplary Practices:</strong> Multiple
            </p>

            <h3>Key Success Factors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear statutory definition of board authority and scope</li>
                <li>Explicit procedures requiring citation of specific standards in disciplinary actions</li>
                <li>Expert consultation for matters at edges of board competence</li>
                <li>Public documentation of decisions with reasoning</li>
                <li>Regular board training on statutory limits and appropriate deference</li>
                <li>Established procedures for boundary questions and authority clarification</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="card">
                This example demonstrates that boundary-respecting behavior is achievable through clear boundary
                definition, consistent procedures, and institutional commitment to boundary maintenance. The case
                provides a model for other regulatory and licensing bodies.
