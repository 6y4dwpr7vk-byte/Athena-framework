            <p>
                The Athena framework is documented in the following academic papers, available for download
                below. These papers provide comprehensive theoretical foundations, methodological details, and
                empirical applications.

                <h3>Judgment Boundary Framework: Theoretical Foundations</h3>
                <p>
                    This paper establishes the theoretical basis for the Judgment Boundary Framework, including
                    formal definitions, analytical constructs, and methodological procedures. The paper synthesizes
                    research from institutional theory, boundary theory, and judgment analysis to create a coherent
                    framework for boundary-respecting systems analysis.

                <h3>Boundary-Respecting Systems in Institutional Contexts</h3>
                <p>
                    This paper applies the framework to diverse institutional contexts, presenting empirical case
                    studies and sociological analysis. The research examines boundary-respecting and boundary-violating
                    behaviors across organizational types and develops practical implications for institutional design.

            <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
            <p>
                The development of the Athena framework drew upon research and insights from multiple disciplines
                and institutional contexts. Acknowledgments of specific contributions appear in the individual
                papers. The framework benefits from ongoing dialogue with practitioners, researchers, and
                institutions committed to boundary-respecting systems.
